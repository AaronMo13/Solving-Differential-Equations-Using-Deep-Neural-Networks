# Solving-Differential-Equations-Using-Deep-Neural-Networks
These are a few files attached to show the code I used for a few examples in my dissertation, Solving Differential Equations Using Deep Neural Networks, which can be found in the projects section of my LinkedIn page: www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-moorey-065302297

## The files attached
Attached is the code for three of the examples which can be found in my report:

- Example 5.3.3 (simple_pdes.py)
- Section 5.4 (L_shaped_polar_coordinates.py)
- Example 6.2.2 (deep_ritz_penalty_L_shaped.py)

The code will not produce the same results as in my report since certain aspects are random, like the initialisation of the weights of the neural networks. The code shows the method I used for these three examples, and is much easier understood when read alongside the dissertation report.

I have included a simple example for a partial differential equation, a slightly more complex example where we have an L-shaped domain and have to convert to polar coordinates, and then finally, an example where we use the Deep Ritz method with a penalty term (to help us meet the boundary conditions) for the same L-shaped domain and equation as the second example.
